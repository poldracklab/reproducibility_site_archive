This would provide a lens for interpreting the results of the usage section. We found a near equal distribution between: PI\/Group leader (32.8%), Postdocs (27.6%), and Graduate students (30.2%). This made up over 90% of our responses with the leftover covering research staff and undergraduates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/reproducibility.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Career_perc_parent.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-936 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/reproducibility.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Career_perc_parent.png\" alt=\"Career_perc_parent\" width=\"600\" height=\"555\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Responders were found to be from 72 unique universities\/research centers with the top 3 concentrated at: University of Iowa (7 labs), UMC Utrecht (5 labs), and Temple University (4 labs).

Overwhelmingly, MRI (solely or in combination with other modalities) is the main modality that researchers are using BIDS to organize. About 15% of respondents reported using BIDS to organize MEG, EEG, or iEEG since their inclusion (April 2018 [<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/sdata2018110\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MEG<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">] and Feb 2019 [<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/psyarxiv.com\/63a4y\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EEG<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/psyarxiv.com\/r7vc2\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">iEEG<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">]). We expect the adoption of BIDS for EEG\/MEG\/iEEG data to increase as awareness spreads and more tools begin to support these datasets. We look forward to supporting and covering other modalities. Below we present the current distribution of data types BIDS is used for. \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/reproducibility.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Datatype_perc_parent.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-938 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/reproducibility.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Datatype_perc_parent.png\" alt=\"Datatype_perc_parent\" width=\"600\" height=\"555\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We found approximately 65,605 subjects have been BIDSified!

These are important key performance indicators in developing our plan for continuing to advance the adoption of BIDS in research pipelines. We found the responders came from a diverse background in regards to their career stage. Our respondents mostly were made up from the United States and Europe. A future direction to improve our geographic diversity outreach would be to extend beyond these regions and target groups, centers, conferences, and journals in underrepresented regions of the world. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking at the types of data organized in BIDS, we aim to further reach out to non-MRI researchers and identify impediments to adoption in those domains. We are happy to observe more 80% of our respondents were using BIDS Apps. A potential limitation of this survey that may bias our results is how it was distributed. To gather feedback from more researchers, more diverse modes of distribution can be utilized.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We would like to thank all the neuroimaging community for their time and valuable feedback!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We recently distributed a survey to evaluate how the neuroimaging community uses BIDS in their labs.
