The survey was shared across several prevalent neuroimaging mailing lists. These results will guide our standardization efforts. The survey focused on derivatives for MRI modalities &#8211; anatomical, functional, and diffusion imaging. We decided the derivative options should be software agnostic to better gauge the outputs the community determined are more generally necessary for reusability and sharing rather than for particular software or analysis. We had a rating system that went from: must have, useful, likely will never look at, and don\u2019t know what this is. We received 139 responses! The responses can be found <a href=\"https:\/\/figshare.com\/articles\/BIDS-Processed_Data_Survey_responses\/6957335\">here<\/a>.

The outputs with over 50% of responses marked \u2018must have\u2019 were: registered image in a template space (i.e. MNI), final preprocessed output image from pipeline (i.e. N4 corrected and merged T1w image for multiple T1w&#8217;s), skull stripped brain image, and the transformation file to MNI space (i.e. .mat or .h5). The outputs with over 50% of responses marked \u2018useful\u2019 were: other structural modalities (i.e. PD, T2w, etc) registered to T1w, cortical surfaces, and the bias corrected image. We have illustrated below the percent of total responses for the ranking of \u2018must have\u2019 or \u2018useful\u2019 across all the outputs (Figure 1 and Figure 2 respectively).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http:\/\/reproducibility.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/test3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-727 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/reproducibility.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/test3.png\" alt=\"ana_t3\" width=\"655\" height=\"469\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em>Figure 1.<\/em> MRI anatomical imaging \u2018must have\u2019 responses for all outputs ordered greatest to least.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-729 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/reproducibility.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/test4.png\" alt=\"Anatomical_useful\" width=\"655\" height=\"469\" \/><em>Figure 2.<\/em> MRI anatomical imaging \u2018useful\u2019 responses for all outputs ordered greatest to least.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One derivative that received the highest marks for both \u2018likely will never look at\u2019 and \u2018don\u2019t know what this is\u2019 was the jacobian map.

MRI Functional Imaging results<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For MRI functional imaging, we found several derivatives achieved over 50% responses marked with the highest rating (\u2018must have\u2019). The outputs that satisfied this metric were: final preprocessed output from pipeline (i.e. BOLD image corrected and sampled to template or output space), registered output in a template space (i.e. MNI), confound regressors, transformation file to T1w space (i.e. .mat or .h5). We have displayed below the percent of total responses for the ranking of \u2018must have\u2019 across all outputs (Figure 3).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/reproducibility.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Func_must_final.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-731 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/reproducibility.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Func_must_final.png\" alt=\"Func_must\" width=\"655\" height=\"469\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300\"><em>Figure 3.<\/em> MRI functional imaging \u2018must have\u2019 responses for all outputs ordered greatest to least.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We found only one derivative, connectomes, had over 50% of responses marked with the second strongest rating (\u2018useful\u2019). The respondents were more familiar with functional outputs due to the \u2018don\u2019t know what this is\u2019 option across all the outputs received less than 6% of responses. Some valuable functional outputs that were not captured in the ranking evaluation and commonly recommended in the free response section were: ICA components and quality control results. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition, we were interested in eliciting feedback regarding cortical analysis. We found that about 51% of our respondents run analysis on cortical surfaces. From those that run analysis on cortical surfaces they prefer to target the individual subject (~110k vertices) and 32k_fs_LR (Human Connectome Project). These were the only options that had over 45% of the responses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a id=\"diffresult\"><\/a><b>3. MRI Diffusion Imaging results<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For MRI diffusion imaging, we found on average about 25% of our respondents marked \u2018don\u2019t know what this is\u2019 across the outputs. The largest \u2018don\u2019t know what this is\u2019 option was for the tractogram file. Interestingly, for all outputs the \u2018likely will never look at\u2019 ranking received 15% or less of the responses. Thus, a majority of the responses indicate that either the outputs identified are \u2018must have\u2019, \u2018useful\u2019, or \u2018don\u2019t know what this is\u2019. This made it intriguing to evaluate the difference between \u2018must have\u2019 and \u2018useful\u2019 responses. The outputs with more pronounced difference (greater than \u00b115%) were: model-derived maps (i.e. FA, MD, AD, RD), eddy corrected image, and deterministic tractography image. We have pictured below the difference between these responses across all the outputs (Figure 4).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/reproducibility.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/dif_dif_final.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-732 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/reproducibility.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/dif_dif_final.png\" alt=\"diff_contrast\" width=\"703\" height=\"504\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<em>Figure 4.<\/em> MRI diffusion imaging difference between \u2018must have\u2019 and \u2018useful\u2019 responses for all outputs ordered\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0greatest to least.

General templates and quality control<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We were interested in what preferred template space and file formats data was in and quality control approaches the community performed. We found the community prefer their template space to be in MNI or fsaverage. In addition, the file formats preference was nifti or gifti. The typical quality control strategies implemented use either a visual approach or quantitative summaries. For the visual approach, we found the common ways that respondents visualized to quality control were through fsleyes (or fslview), freeview, an html page, or another brain viewer software to evaluate the analysis quality (i.e. segmentation or registration). We found for the quantitative reports responses generally utilized the reports provided by running MRIQC, eddyqc, DVARS stats, evaluated motion parameters, assessed the confounds, or another summary report.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a id=\"discussion\"><\/a><b>5. Discussion <\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This survey has provided us valuable insights into what the different derivatives the neuroimaging community determines may be necessary for data reusability and sharing. These insights will provide us with an idea of how to focus our standardization efforts within the processed data domain. In both anatomical and functional imaging derivatives two outputs received over 50% of the strongest marking (\u2018must have\u2019): final preprocessed output image from a pipeline and the transformation file to another space (i.e. .mat or .h5). We found a free response comment that persisted across the modalities was the need to share the quality assessment results, metrics, or logs used to record or make the decision on the processed image quality. The diffusion imaging derivatives could be sampled more due to a quarter of the current respondents don\u2019t know or don\u2019t do diffusion imaging. The results for anatomical and functional imaging are perhaps more robust due to less than 6% of respondents didn\u2019t know what the output was. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We were interested in determining what outputs across modalities the current BIDS extension proposals may already cover.
