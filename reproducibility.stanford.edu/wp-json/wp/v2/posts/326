The ndmg pipeline (<a href=\"https:\/\/pypi.python.org\/pypi\/ndmg\">made in Python<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/neurodata\/ndmg\/\">hosted on Github<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.docker.com\/r\/bids\/ndmg\/\">packaged in Docker<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) has two distinct branches of connectome estimation: diffusion and functional. This part will highlight the diffusion branch currently available in OpenNeuro. Part two of this series will be published once the functional branch, ndmg-f, has been made publicly available through OpenNeuro as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ndmg pipeline is a one-click solution for reliable connectome estimation across a variety of scales [2]. Accepting as input BIDS datasets that include diffusion weighted MR images (DWI), corresponding parameter files (bval; bvec), and a structural scans (T1w, MPRAGE, etc.), the ndmg pipeline performs denoising, registration, tensor extraction, deterministic tractography, and ultimately graph generation across 24 parcellations in 1 mm MNI152 template space [3]. While graph generation code was developed in-house, denoising and registration leverage FSL [4], and tensor extraction and tractography leverage Dipy [5].<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/reproducibility.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/image.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-327\" src=\"http:\/\/reproducibility.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/image.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"800\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Figure 1: Schematic of ndmg<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ndmg pipeline takes approximately 1.5 hours to run, and has been tuned to operate robustly across a wide variety of diffusion imaging techniques, resolutions, and scanner types. The pipeline produces a rich array of quality control figures for intermediate steps in the pipeline and an interactive HTML plot the resulting connectomes in group-level analysis. These figures enable researchers to proof-read their results, spot outliers or potential failures easily, and serves as a springboard for exploratory analysis of the brain graphs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/reproducibility.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Screenshot_22.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-328\" src=\"http:\/\/reproducibility.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Screenshot_22.png\" alt=\"Screenshot_22\" width=\"800\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Figure 2: Graph summary statistics<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ndmg pipeline\u2019s ultimate derivative is connectomes in the form of graph objects. Connectomes are generated by ndmg using 24 different brain atlases, ranging in size from ~50 to ~70,000 nodes. Intermediate derivatives may optionally be stored, using a debug flag, which include aligned DWI images, tensors, and fibers. An exemplar run on OpenNeuro can be found <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/openneuro.org\/datasets\/ds000009\/versions\/00002?app=ndmg&amp;version=17&amp;job=59808ddbc87928000143b00b\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ndmg pipeline have been optimized over the discriminability of derived connectomes. In this context, discriminability is much like Test-Retest reliability: we report the probability that for any given session, the generated connectome is more alike a connectome generated from the same individual in another session than any other session from any other individual within the dataset. We computed this for several datasets, mainly within the CoRR [6] collection, with the peak and trough discriminability scores at 1.0 (perfect score), and 0.88, respectively, with most datasets scoring over 0.98.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We hope that this valuable integration with OpenNeuro and the BIDS specification increases the accessibility of the ndmg pipeline, and provides connectomics researchers with a reliable data processing solution in the cloud.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We encourage feedback, bug-reporting, and contributions on <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/neurodata\/ndmg\/\">our Github repository<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">!
