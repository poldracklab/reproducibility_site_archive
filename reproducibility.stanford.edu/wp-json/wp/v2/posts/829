The development process that began as an idea among researchers and concluded with the extension merged into the main BIDS specification and enabled data submissions to OpenNeuro is a fascinating scientific process and an excellent case of open science and collaboration. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This initiative began in the spring of 2017 by Drs. Dora Hermes and Cyril Pernet in a publicly shared google doc that was able to collect feedback across the community to create the most complete specification taking into account many different perspectives and opinions. This method allowed for researchers around the world to provide their suggestions and lower the barrier to contributing. There is not a formal governance hierarchy beyond extension leads so anyone can comment and contribute their ideas equally (which is very appreciated!). As the extension evolved and expanded, it progressively became spearheaded by Drs. Dora Hermes, Cyril Pernet, Chris Holdgraf, Robert Oostenveld, and Stefan Appelhoff. The google doc was iterated over and meticulously edited over a period of a year and a half taking into account community feedback. Once the google doc reached consensus, the working group was ready to transform the material into a manuscript and submit the markdown file as a pull request on the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bids-standard\/bids-specification\/pull\/108\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bids-specification github<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This pull request was further discussed to ensure consistency with the rest of the main bids specification for a couple of months. The pull request was approved and merged in February of 2019. This marked the end of the long journey to complete their initial goal of extending BIDS into EEG and iEEG data. Looking forward, work is currently underway to extend this organization into <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1PmcVs7vg7Th-cGC-UrX8rAhKUHIzOI-uIOh69_mvdlw\/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">common electrophysiological derivatives<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you are interested, please feel free to join the discussion and voice your perspective! It is also being envisioned that along with archiving of electrophysiological data there will be a more extensive tool to support data visualization, analysis, and meta-analysis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please find example <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/openneuro.org\/datasets\/ds001784\/versions\/1.0.3\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EEG<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/openneuro.org\/datasets\/ds001779\/versions\/1.0.1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">iEEG<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> datasets.
